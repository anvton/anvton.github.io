<br />dear world,
  <br />i am creating a website with the intent to blog and
  <br />upload a sparse portfolio. i intend to do this on
  <br />jekyll because apparently that is the thing to do if
  <br />you want to have a blog hosted by github. the problem
  <br />is that i have no idea how to use github. help.
  <br />
  <br />!!!

<br /><br />dear world,
  <br /><br />i am creating a website with the intent to blog and upload a sparse portfolio. i intend to do this on jekyll
    because apparently that is the thing to do if you want to have a blog hosted by github. the problem is that i have no idea how to use github. help.
  <br />
  <br />!!!
  <br />
  <br /><i>edit</i>: actually, because i have no idea how to do any this, "i am going to blog like it's 1999." -Joe and just code everything. hooray!

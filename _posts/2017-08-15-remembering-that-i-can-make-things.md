title: "Remembering That I Can Make Things"

A few days ago I made a collage. I honestly haven't made enough time for those kinds of things in a while. I guess part of being interested in "science communication" via scientific figures or abstracts has also been a way to veil the pure selfishness of making aethetic things. For some reason, I find it hard to set aside time for doing those things. But, what's really nice about it (having just remembered), is somewhat the effortlessness it feels to do so. In working with acrylic paint, which doesn't have an eraser, it's easy for me to not care about "messing up" or even identify what a mistake is. It's just that every piece or step contributes in a productive way to the creation of the final product. The beginning of work is more fluid and unrestricted, and as you add on more elements, it just becomes more thoughtful.
<br /> <br />Okay. I actually think that what I made could use more whitespace.
<br /> <br />I think that this entire post reveals how OCPD I am.

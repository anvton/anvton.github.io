I've made this soup multiple times in the past after initially finding it at on the NYTimes. With the rainy weather coming up, it felt like another warm and spicy soup was in order. I've modified the recipe a bit to make it a spicier in a complex manner (basically what I do for my chile). i usually double the NYTimes recipe for more leftovers, so I have those amounts here. it makes 3 meals for 2 adults.<br /><br />

<u>materials:</u>
<br />1 26oz can of roasted tomatos
<br />2 qt vegetable broth
<br />1 head of cauliflower
<br />1 tablespoon of chipotle powder
<br />olive oil
<br />1 medium onion, sliced
<br />1 jalepeno pepper (make less spicy by deseeding it), chopped
<br />1 red chinese skinny pepper (make less spicy by deseeding it), chopped
<br />1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, chopped
<br />1 large dried mexican pepper (i have no idea what this one is called; make less spicy by deseeding it), chopped
<br />salt & pepper to taste
<br />1 tsp paprika
<br />1/2 tsp (or to taste) cheyenne pepper
<br />1 cup cilantro, chopped
<br />splash of lime juice

<br /><br />for topping/side: 
<br />corn tortilla chips
<br />1/4 cup red cabbage, chopped
<br />feta cheese
<br />warmed bread
<br /><br />

<u>methods:</u>
<br />for cauliflower rice: preheat oven 400 degrees F. line your baking sheet with parchment paper. using a microplate (or mandolin, or knife), grate cauliflower florets to make cauliflower rice. (i'm sorry, this is the most painstaking part of the recipe; alternatively, trader joe's sells precut cauliflower rice; i would get two bags of them.) when all florets shredded, add in chipotle powder and 1-2 tablespoons olive oil, mix and spread evenly along baking sheet. place in oven for 20 minutes total, mixing every 5 minutes until browned.
<br /><br />for soup: put olive oil, onion and peppers in large dutch oven at medium to high heat on stove. cook until onions translucent, mixing often. can add more olive oil so that onions/ peppers don't burn. add salt and pepper to taste. add canned tomatoes, and cook 10 minutes mixing often. then add 2 qts broth and simmer 30 minutes. afterwards, turn heat down and use an immersion blender until well blended (or regular blender). turn heat back on until simmering. then add lime juice, salt and pepper to taste. turn heat off and add cilantro.
<br /><br />to serve: put a cup or two of cauliflour rice and red cabbage in a bowl. add soup. top with tortilla chips, feta cheese, and a bit of cilantro. can eat with some warmed bread on the side.
<br /><br />i've tried making this thicker by adding an egg, and i don't recommend it. the soup tastes better the next day (as soups usually do!)

Hi. I don't know what to say right now.
<br /><br />I've enjoyed -- maybe not enjoyed -- but benefited from this process of refining my scattered thoughts into something coherent... I guess that if you distill what I just wrote, it means that I benefit from making sentences. How lame.
<br /><br />Anyway, it's always nice to share -- perhaps not share -- but remind myself of what in the world I was thinking in the past. Sometimes I've come up feeling ashamed with why I thought that way, felt that way -- why did I do that? Sometimes I found myself reading something that seems all too familiar, feeling a bit hopeless with regards to self-improvement and growth as I realize that some of the same things that taunted me in the past still find ways to taunt me now. Rarely, I'm a bit surprised by whatever I seemed to have learned in the past, which I forgot over time, and still find useful to remember to practice in my current situation.
<br /><br />It's nice to see these patterns. Anyway, welcome back.

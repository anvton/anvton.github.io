I discovered a new banana bread recipe! It's amazing! I'm still trying to tweak it a bit though, but here's what I got so far...
<br /><br />

<u>materials:</u>
<br />1 cup whole wheat flour
<br />1 cup almond flour
<br />half to 2/3 cups of granulated sugar
<br />1.5 tsp baking powder
<br />1 tsp baking soda
<br />1.25 tsp salt (I use coarse sea salt)
<br />.66 cups of plain yogurt
<br />.5 cups of unsalted butter, melted
<br />2 large eggs
<br />1 tbsp vanilla extract
<br />4 large ripe bananas, peeled & mashed
<br />1.5 cups of mashed walnuts

<br /><br />for topping: 
<br />.33 cups of oats
<br />as-much-or-as-little-as-you-want (I err on the little side... maybe like 1.5 tbsp; recipe originally called for 4) brown sugar
<br />as-much-or-as-little-as-you-want (I use 2-3 tsp; originally called for 1 tsp) cinnamon
<br />pinch of sea salt
<br /><br />

<u>methods:</u>
<br />preheat oven 350 degrees F (original recipe says 300; i've had to extend my baking time by a half hour on this... but maybe my oven is miscalibrated?). line your 9 x 5 inch banana bread container with parchment paper (i used to be lazy about this, but really folding it well makes it a one person job to pour the batter in, and the bread looks better).
<br /><br />whist together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. with a wooden spoon, mix in yogurt, butter, eggs, and vanilla until well incorporated. stir in mashed bananas until well combined. stir in walnuts until well combined. pour in mixture into prepared pan and spread it evenly (i jiggle my pan until it's flat -- i'm not sure if you're supposed to do that...)
<br /><br />for topping: combine the oats, brown sugar & cinnamon in a small bowl, and then just sprinkle it evenly.
<br /><br />the originally recipe says to bake it for 60-65 minutes at 300. for me, i get my knife relatively clean from crumbs after about 75-80 minutes of baking at 350. so i test it out at 60 minutes, and also end up judging that it needs another 15 minutes... after which, i then let it cool for 15 minutes in the pan. you can eat this warm afterwards, but what i think is tastier is to eat it the next day after refrigeration (really improves taste and texture). so i tranfser the banana bread to an airtight container and store at 4 degrees overnight.
<br /><br />the original recipe says that it will store at RT for 3 days; i usually store it at 4 degrees... but, between j & me it is usually gone by 2-3 days nonetheless..
<br /><br />you can play with this. i tried adding chocolate and it really, really ruined it in the sense that it was less banana-y and more generic chocolate cake. the texture, the butter, the bananas, and the salt really meld together and make this a wonderful banana bread. 
<br /><br />now, i am sitting here with a nice slice of banana bread smoothered with hazelnut butter paired with a cup of coffee. what a life.

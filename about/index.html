i'm a vietnamese-american psychiatrist living and learning in new york city, which at times feels like a microcosm of the world if it was all colonized by the u.s. i grew up in the conservative hubs of arizona and orange county (although now worship the new york times). i am relishing the feeling of freedom and levity, through self expression in dressing brightly, dancing wildly, walking quickly, and laughing loudly to the confusion of others. i exude the warmth i desire. i grieve as i breathe, in my attempts to let go and accept what it is. in seeing fluctuations and cycles as part of living, i learn to be more compassionate and alive. i find meaning in humanity and feeling connected to it. 
<br /><br />this website is a secret website that you have somehow stumbled upon despite my attempts to hide this. yes, my name is literally plastered all over this page, but it is somehow hidden enough to not be cataloged by robots that crawl across the interwebs. my ambivlance with not wanting to be seen (especially by my patients), but also to be seen (by those who i love or love me). here, my fetish of exhibitionism is exposed, which is limited by my fear of violence from this exposure. please don't kill me.
<br /><br />this website is hosted on github, blog is via jerkyll, i am typing all of this shitty code myself in this web-based file editor/uploaded on github, maybe i can make it prettier sometime soon! it was born in 2017, out of a desire to be as creative as my tweenage, only-child self.
<br /><br />GO VISIT MY FRIEND JENN AT <a href="http://butter.city" target="_blank">butter.city</a> for kewl recipes. (HI, JENN!)

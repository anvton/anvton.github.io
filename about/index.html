i'm a vietnamese-american student applying for psychiatry residency and living in san francisco, a wonderfully, liberal bubble. i grew up in the conservative hubs of arizona and orange county (although now worship the new york times), like making things (but now find it hard to make things without a reason to give them to others), and really like spending time with my partner (via video games, travelling, taking long walks, or bugging him with heavy questions right before bed). i teeter between being excited to exist to questioning why i exist. i guess that means i'm human.
<br /><br />i am also trying to build my graphic design portfolio so please contact me if you'd like at eh-en-vee-ton at gmail.com (sorry, i just don't want spam, just say it out loud and actual roman letters will come to mind). for free!
<br /><br />this website is hosted on github, blog is via jerkyll, i am typing all of this shitty code myself in this web-based file editor/uploaded on github, maybe i can make it prettier sometime soon!

i'm a vietnamese-american psychiatrist living and learning in new york city, which at times feels like a microcosm of the world if it was all colonized by the u.s. i grew up in the conservative hubs of arizona and orange county (although now worship the new york times). i am relishing the feeling of freedom and levity, through self expression in dressing brightly, dancing wildly, walking quickly, and laughing loudly to the confusion of others. i exude the warmth i desire. i grieve as i breathe, in my attempts to let go and accept what it is. in seeing fluctuations and cycles as part of living, i learn to be more compassionate and alive. i find meaning in humanity and feeling connected to it.
<br /><br />i am also trying to build my graphic design portfolio so please contact me if you'd like at eh-en-vee-ton at gmail.com (sorry, i just don't want spam, just say it out loud and actual roman letters will come to mind). for free!
<br /><br />this website is hosted on github, blog is via jerkyll, i am typing all of this shitty code myself in this web-based file editor/uploaded on github, maybe i can make it prettier sometime soon! it was born in 2017, out of a desire to be as creative as my tweenage, only-child self.

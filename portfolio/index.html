i have been doing graphic/ website/ print design for many years, and taught myself when i was 11 years old using corel's paint shop pro, microsoft notepad, and lissa explains it all. i received more formal training in print design through involvement in my high school and college yearbook where i learned about indesign and what a pica was. i've since done various projects sporadically, including involvement with the NIH bivisualization studio.
i would like to continue to build my graphic design portfolio, so if you like what you see here, please contact me if you'd like at eh-en-vee-ton at gmail.com (sorry, i just don't want spam, just say it out loud and actual roman letters will come to mind). for free!

<br /><br /><b>logo design for <a href="https://tabladevices.com" target="_blank">tabla devices</a></b>
<br /><img src="" align="left" />my classmate adam rao asked me to create a logo for tabla, a medical device that he is a making that borrows from the concept of percussion during a physician's physical exam. as i found that the name tabla, the name of a drum, captured the more creative, i wanted to portray the scientific and quantitative aspect of the instrument by trying to depict sound waves, but in a less obvious and more aesthetic way by conveying it in a circular wave form. please click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5fIVhbp_RKBZm9pWjc0aFNtLXc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> to view alternate logos (opens as .pdf).

<br /><br /><b>scientific figures for UCSF school of medicine course syllabus</b>
<br /><img src="" align="left" />i worked with a course director, dr. tracy fulton, to create new figures that depict different steps of glucose metabolism. she had initially borrowed figures from a textbook, and my role was to uniformly design the figures, simplify them to what was only needed to be viewed, and also subtly emphasize concepts in the figures that may assist understanding of the pathways being depicted. please click <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> to view selected figures.

<br /><br /><b>scientific abstract for nature medicine publication</b>
<br /><img src="" align="left" />i worked with my mentor at the time to create a scientific abstract that illustrated the findings of our paper. please click <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> to view selected figures.

<br /><br /><b>cover art for nucleic acids research publication</b>
<br /><img src="" align="left" />i was asked by a neighboring laboratory to design a cover depicting the findings of their research article. in this piece, i collaborated with jeremy swan of the NIH biovisualization studio. please click <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> to view selected figures.
